# Creating Reusable Features in this Project

This guide outlines the recommended structure and implementation model for creating new reusable features within this project. Adhering to this structure ensures consistency, maintainability, and ease of integration.

## Folder Structure

Each new feature should reside in its own dedicated directory under `app/features/`. The recommended structure for a new feature, let's call it `myFeature`, is as follows:

```
app/features/
├── myFeature/
│   ├── index.ts
│   ├── myFeature.md
│   ├── components/
│   │   ├── MyFeatureComponent.tsx
│   │   └── AnotherComponent.tsx
│   ├── providers/
│   │   └── MyFeatureProvider.tsx
│   └── settings/
│       └── MyFeatureSettings.tsx
```

### Explanation of Directories and Files:

*   **`myFeature/`**: The root directory for your new feature.
*   **`index.ts`**: This file serves as the main entry point for the feature. It should export the primary components, hooks, or providers that other parts of the application will consume.
*   **`myFeature.md`**: A markdown file providing documentation specific to this feature, including its purpose, how to use it, and any specific considerations.
*   **`components/`**: This directory houses all React components that are part of the feature's user interface. These components should be self-contained and ideally only depend on the feature's `providers` or standard React/utility libraries.
*   **`providers/`**: This directory contains React Context Providers. These providers are crucial for managing the feature's state, logic, and any data fetching. They encapsulate the feature's core functionality, making it reusable and testable.
*   **`settings/`**: If your feature requires user-configurable settings, this directory should contain a dedicated settings component (e.g., `MyFeatureSettings.tsx`). This component should provide the UI for users to adjust the feature's behavior.

## Implementation Model

1.  **Define the Core Logic**: Start by identifying the core functionality and state management required for your feature. This logic should primarily reside within a React Context Provider in the `providers/` directory.
2.  **Create UI Components**: Develop the necessary React components in the `components/` directory. These components will consume the context provided by your feature's provider to display data and interact with the feature's logic.
3.  **Implement Settings (if applicable)**: If your feature has configurable options, create a settings component in the `settings/` directory. This component will allow users to customize the feature's behavior, typically by interacting with the feature's context or a global settings store.
4.  **Export Public API**: Use the `index.ts` file to export the main components, hooks, or providers that other parts of the application will need to import to use your feature.
5.  **Document the Feature**: Create a `[feature_name].md` file to document the feature's purpose, how to integrate it, and any specific usage instructions or examples.

## Porting Features to Other Projects

To port a feature to another project, follow these general steps:

1.  **Copy the Feature Directory**: Copy the entire `app/features/[feature_name]` directory to the new project's equivalent feature or module location.
2.  **Review Dependencies**: Check the `package.json` of the original project for any dependencies specific to your feature (e.g., new libraries). Install these dependencies in the new project if they are not already present.
3.  **Adjust Imports**: Update any absolute or relative import paths within the feature's files to match the new project's structure.
4.  **Integrate Providers**: If your feature uses a React Context Provider, ensure it is integrated into the new project's component tree, typically near the root or a relevant parent component, so that its context is available to the components that need it.
5.  **Integrate UI Components**: Place the feature's UI components where they are needed in the new project's layout.
6.  **Configure Settings**: If the feature has a settings component, integrate it into the new project's settings or configuration UI.
7.  **Test Thoroughly**: After porting, thoroughly test the feature in the new project environment to ensure all functionalities work as expected.
