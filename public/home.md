# Welcome!

I'm **JoÃ£o Kawamura** â€” These are a few demos I've authored -  This is always a work in progress. If you have any questions, suggestions, or issues, feel free to reach out to me at [joaodk@gmail.com](mailto:joaodk@gmail.com). Particularly I ask that you do not abuse the LLM-based features - as i run the risk of running out of credits.

## ðŸ§  Research Assistant Demo

Entity extraction is one of the first things I remember testing with LLMs "back in the day". Even though there was obviously a lot of potential, it was also *really* painful to implement â€” the first LLMs were not very good at generating structured output following a schema. It was especially painful when testing different models. The implementation was heavily dependent on both the model and the prompt, and it was common for models to make subtle, arbitrary changes to the specified JSON format. When function calling was introduced, it really made things easier - and I made a preliminary version of this demo when i first began testing function calling.

Graph representation of content presents a possible path for enhancing RAG pipelines, but beyond that I tried to explore if there is an opportunity to support learning.

### Why does this matter?

well, A lot of the AI applications I've seen are, to some extent, replacing human work â€” making it simpler and more efficient. But we still want and need to study and understand topics that are increasingly complex. So how can LLMs help us with that?

There's some movement in  edtech exploring "Socratic assistants," but I haven't seen many applications exploring how AI can support us in *researching* a topic. This is my exploration in that space.


### Future Plans

Of Course as any personal project the roadmap is huge ;) I'd like to expand this with, but when i have the time, I would like to expand this with better graph visualizations, maybe work with longer format texts (like books) and see how larger graphs can generate insight.

## ðŸ’¡ About These Demos

These projects represent my ongoing exploration of practical LLM applications. Each demo focuses on solving real problems I've encountered while working with language models, from structured data extraction to research assistance.

The code and implementations are continuously evolving as new capabilities and techniques emerge in the field.
