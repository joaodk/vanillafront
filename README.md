Vanilla Front

a simple and lean application that includes:

-user authentication/sign-in/identity,etc through clerk
-payments and subscriptions through clerk/stripe
-a chat interface for LLMs

Purpose: to serve as a template and stepping stone for more specific applications.


Next steps:

-make it work smoothly with a custom back-end


-add tool-use and a mcp server connection

currently working on:

replace the thread component in the @app/routes/audiochat.tsx for a new component, called

replace the thread in the @app/routes/audiochat.tsx route for a new component, that has a button in the bottom that alternates between the states: Idle -action start - (clicks leads to ) -> listening -action stop-(click leads to Idle). while listening it will record audio, the recordings will be saved and shown in a table, just above the button. for each recording, there is a play/stop button next to it.

, and then transcribe and print the transcription to a text area above the button. 

-propose a plan to submit the audio as chunks to the transcriber module, so that we can have a seeemingly continuous transcription, that will emulate a text stream that gets written to the screen. at first, lets consider a fixed duration for the chunks, which we can improve later.


-now, is it possible to improve the chunking approach, by detecting pauses/silences in the audio, then chunking when a pause/silence is detected? make a plan to do so. 

i am implementing a chunking approach to audio transcription, in

change the behavior of the audiochat to when the "start" button is clicked, the application will continuously record the audio in chunks of 5 seconds, and only stop generating chunks when i click on "stop"


prompt for entity extraction:
Advanced Knowledge Graph Extraction 

You are an information extraction system.

Given a book passage, build a knowledge graph-style representation that captures:

1. Entities

Each entity must include:

id (unique, e.g. "E1", "E2")

name (surface form from the text)

type (Character, Location, Object, Concept, Event, Organization, Summary)

attributes (optional descriptive properties: role, title, description, traits, etc.)

parent_id (if part of a hierarchy, e.g. “Mordor” is part of “Middle-earth”)

2. Relationships

Each relationship must include:

id (unique, e.g. "R1", "R2")

entity1_id (ID of first entity)

relationship (phrase that reads naturally, e.g. is friend of, is located in, carries)

entity2_id (ID of second entity)

type (Factual | Conceptual | Summary)

score (1–5 relevance, where 1 = most central/important to the narrative, 5 = minor/ancillary)

context (optional supporting text snippet or explanation)

position (approximate paragraph/chapter/book offset or index where extracted)

Relationships should read naturally in the form:

<Entity1> <relationship> <Entity2>

3. Summaries

Whenever possible, generate summary entities and link them:

Paragraph Summary

Create an entity of type "Summary" for each paragraph.

Add a relationship ParagraphX "summarizes" ParagraphX_Summary.

Chapter Summary

Create an entity of type "Summary" for each chapter.

Add a relationship ChapterX "summarizes" ChapterX_Summary.

Book Summary

Create a single "Summary" entity for the book.

Add a relationship Book "summarizes" Book_Summary.

Summaries can be of two types:

Factual Summary (objective narrative events)

Conceptual Summary (themes, motifs, abstract meanings)

Annotate summaries accordingly in their entity attributes.type = "Factual Summary" or "Conceptual Summary".

4. Concept Groups

Group abstract/thematic concepts (e.g. Friendship, Corruption of Power, Destiny, War).

Represent them as "Concept" entities, and link them to characters/objects/events with relationships like:

Frodo "embodies" Courage

The One Ring "represents" Corruption of Power

}

6. Guidelines

Always nest locations inside larger locations.

Add summary entities at paragraph, chapter, and book levels.

Annotate summary type (Factual vs Conceptual).

Assign relevance scores to relationships.

Keep relationships natural-language-readable.

Store position metadata to allow reconstruction of the text’s knowledge timeline.
