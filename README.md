Vanilla Front

a simple and lean application that includes:

-user authentication/sign-in/identity,etc through clerk
-payments and subscriptions through clerk/stripe
-a chat interface for LLMs

Purpose: to serve as a template and stepping stone for more specific applications.


Next steps:

-make it work smoothly with a custom back-end


-add tool-use and a mcp server connection

currently working on:

-add a 


-render a blank rectangle over the chat window on @audiochat.tsx so that the chat components are not visible. render a blank rectangle instead.



replace the thread component in the @app/routes/audiochat.tsx for a new component, called 
│   audiochatview - this component is initialized at first in an idle state - and will show a                  
│   button-like actionable "start" label. once started, it will move on to "listening" state. when in 
│   listening state, it will record the audio from the default microphone.

replace the thread in the @app/routes/audiochat.tsx route for a new component, that has a button in the bottom that alternates between the states: Idle -action start - (clicks leads to ) -> listening -action stop-(click leads to Idle). while listening it will record audio, the recordings will be saved and shown in a table, just above the button. for each recording, there is a play/stop button next to it.

, and then transcribe and print the transcription to a text area above the button. 

-propose a plan to submit the audio as chunks to the transcriber module, so that we can have a seeemingly continuous transcription, that will emulate a text stream that gets written to the screen. at first, lets consider a fixed duration for the chunks, which we can improve later.


-now, is it possible to improve the chunking approach, by detecting pauses/silences in the audio, then chunking when a pause/silence is detected? make a plan to do so. 

i am implementing a chunking approach to audio transcription, in 

looks like the first transcription worked, all subsequent ones failed.  we get a "TranscriptionProvider.tsx:109 EncodingError occurred. This might be due to an invalid audio chunk." error.
